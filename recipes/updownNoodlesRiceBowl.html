    <h2>Time</h2>
    <h3>18 mins</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 nest of vermicelli rice noodles (50g)</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 x 320g packet of mixed stir-fry veg</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>30g unsalted cashew nuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 x 250g packet of cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>2 free range eggs</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Sichuan chilli oil</li>
        <li>Â½ a bunch of coriander (15g)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rehydrate the noodles in a deep 16cm serving bowl according to the packet instructions, then drain, return to the bowl, and toss in a little sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Tip the stir-fry veg into a very hot large non-stick frying pan with a little olive oil and the cashews and fry for 4 minutes, or until just tender, tossing regularly. Season to perfection 
            with the soy, then pile the veg into the bowl on top of the noodles.</li>
        <li>Crumble the rice into the same pan, squeezing over the juice of 1 lime. Once hot, layer on top of the veg and press down with a fish slice to compact.</li>
        <li>Quickly wipe out the pan and place back on a medium heat. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, crack in the eggs and season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then dust with curry 
            powder. Cook to your liking, spooning over the hot oil as they cook.</li>
        <li>Turn out the bowl (like a sandcastle!), top with the spiced fried eggs, spoon over Sichuan chilli oil to taste, and pick over the coriander leaves. Squeeze over the remaining lime juice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
