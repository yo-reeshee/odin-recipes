        <li>12 free-range chicken wings (roughly 1kg)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Buffalo sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
        <li>30g blue cheese</li>
        <li>½ a bunch of fresh chives (10g)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buffalo hot sauce (or your favorite hot sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350°F/gas 4. Pat the chicken wings dry with kitchen paper, then season with a couple pinches of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place in a large bowl and toss with the baking powder, paprika and dried rosemary to coat.</li>
        <li>Place the wings on an oiled rack on top of a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes. Turn the wings over, turn the heat up to 220ºC/425°F/gas 7 and roast 
            for a further 30 minutes, or until beautifully golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, spoon the yoghurt with a pinch of pepper, then crumble in the blue cheese. Finely chop the chives, add half to the yoghurt and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the hot crispy chicken wings to the bowl and toss to coat. Arrange on a platter and scatter over the remaining chives, then serve with the buffalo sauce for dunking.</li>
    </ol>
