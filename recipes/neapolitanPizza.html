    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an all timer, pizza as pizza was intended. A beautifully simple but tasty Neapolitan pizza
        that has a classic base and the perfect mix of <strong>tangy</strong> yet <strong>savoury</strong> flavours from the marinara
        sauce and mozzarella. Tons of fresh basil to boot, to cut through for freshness and <strong>aromatic</strong> herb flavours with
        a sprinkle of pepper at the end for the perfect bite.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This recipe uses an overnight proving time for the dough</li>
        <li>Make your dough the night before so it's ready to use the next evening</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Base</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the 700ml of lukewarm water with 20g of sea salt. Gradually mix in a small handful of the flour to break the water 
            and start to turn it into a batter. Mix in the yeast and leave for 2 minutes. 
            Gradually mix in 90% of the remaining flour until you have a pliable, soft dough.</li>
        <li>Tip the remaining flour on to a clean surface and knead the dough for 20 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (or 10 minutes
            in a free-standing mixer with a dough hook). Place in a floured bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and prove for 1 hour, 
            or until <em>roughly</em> doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Knock out the air with your fists, roll into a sausage shape, chop into 6 equal pieces and roll each one into a ball, stretching 
            the edges underneath. Place on an oiled tray, drizzle with oil, cover with clingfilm and the tea towel and prove overnight in the 
            fridge (for better flavour and a more relaxed dough).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Pizza</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to full whack (240ºC/475ºF/gas 9) and place a pizza stone inside. Use a fish slice to move one ball of dough on 
            to a flour-dusted surface.</li>
        <li>Press the ball out into a fat round disc, then pick it up and gently turn and stretch it to 30cm in diameter, using gravity to 
            help you. Stretch it over the back of your fists, then place on a floured pizza paddle or board – the dough should be a little 
            thicker around the edges. Pull it into shape and give it a jiggle so you know it&rsquo;s free-moving.</li>
        <li>Ladle marina sauce onto the pizza base and spread until evenly covered then sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the sauce, take care not to 
            oversauce or undersauce. Break up your mozzarella balls into smaller chunks and spread them about onto the pizza, they will flatten as 
            they heat so don&rsquo;t worry. Grate some parmesan onto the pizza to taste, add more if you like the nuttiness of parmesan.
            Grab a couple leaves of fresh basil and place them wherever you like on the pizza.</li>
        <li>Quickly shunt on to your pizza stone and close the oven door to retain heat. Wait 7 or 8 minutes and it&rsquo;ll be golden, crisp and ready to eat.</li>
        <li>Grind some fresh pepper to taste to give you pizza a spruce and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
